# Sapphire-Assistant-Framework
A free and open source offline assistant for Android phones. Should work for Android versions 7.1.1 to 10.0. I'm aiming to have it work with 11, just not a priority yet

I am starting to update the wiki based on my own hacking ideas for it, roadmaps, ideas, and the like. If you have a question about how it should work, feel free to open an issue and ask. I'll add the information to the wiki so that way the whole community benefits
